This project predicts movie revenue categories (Hit, Average, Flop) using machine learning models applied to metadata such as budget, genre, popularity, and release date.
The goal is to compare different ML models and identify the best-performing approach for ROI-based prediction.

Methods & Models：Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM (RBF), Gradient Boosting, Tang-style Optimized XGBoost, Gupta-style Ensemble (Voting & Stacking), LightGBM (Novel model).
We evaluate both classical models and modern boosting-based models, following the designs in Tang (2024) and Gupta (2023), and extend the comparison with LightGBM.
